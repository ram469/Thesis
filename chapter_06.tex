\chapter{Conclusions and future scope}
Many of the high performance parallel implementations are discussed in this work. GPU parallel implementation for image processing and computer vision algorithms Adaptive contrast enhancement, motion de-blur is discussed. A basic approach to implement those algorithms on GPU is presented, and a very expert implementation on GPU are explained for autonomous drive algorithm stereo disparity block matching. In the stereo disparity block matching algorithm discussed about the usage of CUDA intrinsics, parallel streams, shared memory and texture memory.

\paragraph*{}Not only the GPU implementation, but a parallel high performance implementation through CPU is also mentioned at autonomous drive algorithms temporal denoising and fog rectification. The complete utilization of multi-core CPU is explained, the approaches to extract parallel performance for data dependent operations using pipelining is focused at fog rectification.The high performance implementations can be extended to the advanced technological areas like deep learning, visual computing etc. Some more areas like finance, marketing, statistical analytics also benefit from the high performance computing.
