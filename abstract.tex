	Traditional Hardware are inefficient for performance driven computer vision applictions.Since computer vision algorithms deals with images and in detail the beneath pixels.Some of the algorithms directly operate on individual pixels or a group of pixels and need not worry about other pixels or other group of pixels.In such cases if the processing elements available in the hardware are enough to operate on all the pixels simultaneously then a huge performance can be observed.Hardware with good speeds in sequential operations is not suitable for the above described case.This limitation can be overcome by modifying algorithm according to the hardware or Adding additional hardware inadditional to the master hardware.In this work using additional hardware for master hardware is focused more.The additional hardware capabilities should be complement to the master hardware then only the incapable operations by the master hardware can be implemented by the extra hardware.
