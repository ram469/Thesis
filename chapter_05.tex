\chapter{Conclusions and future scope}
In this work, different kinds of high performance parallel implementations are discussed. Adaptive contrast enhancement and Motion de-blur applications are implemented using GPGPU and corresponding design, implementation and performance details are discussed. The techniques of extracting data parallelism from a sequential flow is explained in these applications. Speedups in the range of 3X to 9X are reported here.\paragraph*{}Fog rectification and temporal denoising algorithms are implemented on Renesas Multi-core CPU SoC platform. The complete utilization of multiple CPU cores is explained in these applications. Also, the concepts of pipelining and task based parallelism are explained in great detail. Performance analysis is done and results are reported. Speedups in the range of 1.5X to 2.5X are reported here. For stereo disparity, block matching algorithm is discussed using CUDA intrinsics, shared memory and texture memory. A scalable design using parallel streams is also discussed here. \paragraph*{}The high performance implementation ideas discussed in this work can be further extended to the advanced technological areas like deep learning, visual computing etc. Some more areas like finance, marketing, statistical analytics also benefit from the high performance computing.
